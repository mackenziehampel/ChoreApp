This app was developed for families to keep track of who is doing what chore
It implements a table view that sections off each user to display the users assigned
chores for a given day. It implements a cocoa pod calendar that when a day is selected 
it takes you to a screen to view the chores for that day and gives the chance to 
add more chores.
